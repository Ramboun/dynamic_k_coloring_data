    - see parameters descriptions at https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.html
	
	- minGap: 	Empty space after leader [m]. Default value: 2.5
	- accel: 	The acceleration ability of vehicles of this type (in m/s^2). Default value: 2.6
	- decel:	The deceleration ability of vehicles of this type (in m/s^2). Default value: 4.5
	- length: 	The vehicle's netto-length (length) (in m). Default value: 5
	- maxSpeed:	The vehicle's maximum velocity (in m/s). Default value: 70m/sec (250 km/h)	
	- sigma: 	Car-following model parameter, The driver imperfection (0 denotes perfect driving.	Default value: 0.5) If using value of 0.5 the cars do not always keep the safe safety distance, nor the same steady speed
	
	- speedFactor	The vehicles expected multiplicator for lane speed limits
		 Default value: 1.0
		 Using speedFactor="normc(1,0.1,0.2,2)" will result in a speed distribution where 95% of the vehicles drive between 80% and 120% of the legal speed limit. 
		 Currently not used.
		 
	- speedDev		The deviation of the speedFactor; see below for details (some vClasses use a different default). 
		Default value: 0.1
		Value of 0.0 makes all cars have the exact same speed
